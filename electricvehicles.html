            <p>All forms of electric vehicles (EVs) can help improve fuel economy, lower fuel
                costs, and reduce emissions. The market for electric vehicles (EVs) has grown rapidly
                over the past decade and is expected to surge in the years to come.</p>
                <p>Today, consumers can pick between a growing number of makes and models of
                all-electric, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Electricity is cheaper than gasoline
                or diesel fuel, and Americans are increasingly turning to EVs due to concerns about
                carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from gasoline-powered cars and rising fuel costs.</p>
                <p>Electric and hybrid vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over
                conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions,
                and PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions when operating in all-electric mode.
                HEV emissions benefits vary by vehicle model and type of hybrid power system.</p>
                <p>Lastly, electric vehicles (EVs), including all-electric, hybrid, and plug-in
                hybrid models, offer promising solutions to improving fuel economy, reducing fuel
                costs, and cutting emissions. With a growing market and increasing consumer options,
                EVs provide an opportunity to address environmental concerns and mitigate the impact
                of gasoline-powered vehicles on carbon dioxide emissions. This trend is expected to
                continue as more consumers recognize the economic and environmental benefits of
                transitioning to electric transportation.</p>
