								Green energy, often referred to as renewable energy, encompasses various 
								sources such as sunlight, wind, water, and biomass that are naturally 
								replenished and have minimal environmental impact. This sustainable 
								approach to energy generation aims to reduce dependence on finite fossil 
								fuels and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. By harnessing 
								the power of these renewable resources, we can create a cleaner, more 
								sustainable future while simultaneously promoting economic growth and 
								energy security. Embracing green energy technologies not only reduces 
								greenhouse gas emissions but also fosters innovation and job creation in 
								the rapidly evolving renewable energy sector.

								Solar cells, the building blocks of Solar Panels, 
								consist of layers of semiconductor materials. Silicon is commonly used 
								due to its semiconducting properties. The silicon is doped 
								with specific elements to create a positive and a negative layer.
							</p>
							<p>
								When sunlight, composed of photons, strikes the solar cells, the 
								energy from the photons is absorbed by the semiconductor material. 
								This absorption causes electrons in the material to become energized 
								and break free from their atomic bonds, creating electron-hole pairs. 
								The positive and negative layers within the solar cell create an 
								electric field, causing these free electrons to move towards the 
								negative layer and the holes towards the positive layer.
							</p>
							<p>
								The electrons move through an external circuit to recombine with the 
								holes, an electric current is generated. This flow of electrons constitutes 
								the electricity that can be harnessed for various applications. The efficiency
								of a solar panel is influenced by factors such as the quality of the 
								semiconductor material, the design of the solar cells, and environmental 
								conditions like sunlight intensity and temperature.

						Solar panels are interconnected to form solar arrays, allowing for 
						the generation of more substantial amounts of electricity. Inverter systems are 
						used to convert the direct current (DC) produced by the solar panels into 
						alternating current (AC), which is the standard form of electricity used 
						in homes and businesses. The photovoltaic process in solar panels represents 
						a clean and sustainable way to transform solar energy into a usable 
						electrical form.
