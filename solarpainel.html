                Solar cells, the building blocks of Solar Panels, 
                consist of layers of semiconductor materials. Silicon is commonly used 
                due to its semiconducting properties. The silicon is doped 
                with specific elements to create a positive and a negative layer.

                When sunlight, composed of photons, strikes the solar cells, the 
                energy from the photons is absorbed by the semiconductor material. 
                This absorption causes electrons in the material to become energized 
                and break free from their atomic bonds, creating electron-hole pairs. 
                The positive and negative layers within the solar cell create an 
                electric field, causing these free electrons to move towards the 
                negative layer and the holes towards the positive layer.
            </p>

                The electrons move through an external circuit to recombine with the 
                holes, an electric current is generated. This flow of electrons constitutes 
                the electricity that can be harnessed for various applications. The efficiency
                of a solar panel is influenced by factors such as the quality of the 
                semiconductor material, the design of the solar cells, and environmental 
                conditions like sunlight intensity and temperature.

                Solar panels are interconnected to form solar arrays, allowing for 
                the generation of more substantial amounts of electricity. Inverter systems are 
                used to convert the direct current (DC) produced by the solar panels into 
                alternating current (AC), which is the standard form of electricity used 
                in homes and businesses. The photovoltaic process in solar panels represents 
                a clean and sustainable way to transform solar energy into a usable 
                electrical form.
